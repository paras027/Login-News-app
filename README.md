# Login-News-app

I have made login news app in which user has to signup firstly and that data will get stored in real time database and is authenticated in google firebase then while logging in it will check the details entered with data stored in firebase if it is correctit will login us to the news app.
View Pager is used to swipe between fragments of login and sign up.
Used volley library to call api but its not working sometimes maybe because newsapi has closed the use of api for free.
Used glide library to get and set the image from api.


I didnt know about firebase before but after working on this project now i feel confident in backend also.
